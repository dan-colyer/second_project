This project gave me a chance to practice Test Driven Development (validating class methods) 
and SOLID principles (particularly, Dependency Inversion).

Prior to implementation, I designed the class structure and relationships with class diagrams.


Brief:
##Mario's Italian Restaurant

Mario is opening a new restaurant in Edinburgh and needs your help getting it organised.

###MVP

- The restaurant should have a name and budget
- Patrons can come and eat at the restaurant. They will be added to a table when they come in to eat.
- Patrons can order from a menu. It should consist of dishes that have prices and ingredients.
- Mario wants to be able to calculate the total price for each table and add it to the budget of the restaurant when the patron pay.
- After paying, patrons are removed from the table to make room for the next ones.

###Extensions
- Patrons can split up the bill and pay individually
- Dishes can be customised for dietary needs
- Add a kitchen that gets ingredients delivered and has a pantry to keep them.
- Ingredients are removed when dishes are ordered (hint: customised dishes use different ingredients)
- When the kitchen runs out of an ingredient, all dishes using that ingredient have to be removed from the menu
- And/or anything else that you can think of...
